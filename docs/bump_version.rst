.. _bump-version:

==============================================
Bumping the version of an existing project
==============================================

| Increasing the version of an already existing project is often times a cumbersome and error prone process, since the version has to be changed in multiple places.
| To facilitate this process, qube provides a :code:`bump-version` command, which conveniently increases the version across several files.
| Additionally, always adding new sections to the changelog is an annoying process. bump-version therefore inserts a new section into the changelog using the specified new version.

.. code::

    New Version (Date)
    ------------------

    **Added**

    **Fixed**

    **Dependencies**

    **Deprecated**

bump-version will verify that your new version adheres to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ and that you are not trying to update it unreasonably.
It is for example not allowed to bump from 2.0.0 to 7.1.2, since in a normal development workflow only 2.0.1, 2.1.0 or 3.0.0 adhere to consecutive `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
Note that SNAPSHOT versions are allowed! Hence, :code:`qube bump-version 1.2.5-SNAPSHOT` is allowed. However, it must still follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
Version 1.2.5 therefore cannot be the predecessor of 1.2.5-SNAPSHOT, but only 1.2.4.

Usage
---------

The :code:`bump-version` command follows the syntax

.. code-block:: console

    $ qube bump-version <OPTIONS> X.X.X <PATH>

| where ``X`` corresponds to a (python)-integer value of any possible range.
| The PATH corresponds to the path to the qube.cfg file, which contains all locations, where the version should be increased.
| Note that you donÂ´t need to specify a path, if your current working directory contains the :code:`qube.cfg` file.

Use the ``--downgrade`` option to downgrade your version. The changelog will not be changed. Only use this option as a last resort if something went horribly wrong in your development process.
In a normal development workflow this should never be necessary.


.. _bump-version-configuration:

Configuration
------------------

| All templates of qube ship with a :code:`qube.cfg` file, which defines all files :code:`bump-version` examines.

The :code:`bump-version` configuration begins with the section::

    [bumpversion]
    current_version = 0.1.0

where the current version is defined. All files are either white- or blacklisted (see below for explanations).
An arbitrary name is followed by the path to the file: ``arbitrary_name = path_to_file``.

Whitelisted files are listed below a ``[bumpversion_files_whitelisted]`` section, e.g.::

    [bumpversion_files_whitelisted]
    dot_qube = .qube.yml
    conf_py = docs/conf.py

| All files, which are whitelisted are searched for patterns matching ``X.X.X``, which are updated to the specified new versions.
| Any lines, which contain the string :code:`<<QUBE_NO_BUMP>>` will be ignored.

If files like Maven pom.xml files, contain many version patterns matching ``X.X.X``, it may be a better idea to blacklist them (section ``[bumpversion_files_blacklisted]``) and enable only specific lines to be updated::

    [bumpversion_files_blacklisted]
    pom = pom.xml

Analogously to whitelisted files, which allow for specific lines to be ignored, blacklisted files allow for specific lines to be forcibly updated using the string :code:`<<QUBE_FORCE_BUMP>>`.

Note that those tags must be on the same line as the version (commonly placed in a comment), otherwise they wont work!
